Sample shipments that require an End-Use Certificate for CW reasons: No CWC Schedule 3 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.c is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license, unless an End-Use Certificate issued by the government of the importing country is obtained by the exporter prior to export (see §745.2 of the EAR for End-Use Certificate requirements).\nd. Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR.\ne. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.\n2. MIXTURES:\na. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b through .d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs.\nb. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\nNote to Mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals:\na. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations;\nb. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents.\n3. COMPOUNDS. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\n4. TESTING KITS: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)\n Technical Notes:\n 1. For purposes of this entry, a mixture is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions.\n 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates.\n 3. Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable). Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates, isotopically-labeled forms or all possible stereoisomers) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number. CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying whether a particular precursor chemical or mixture is controlled under ECCN 1C350, irrespective of nomenclature. However, CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers in all situations because some forms of the listed precursor chemical have different CAS numbers, and mixtures containing a precursor chemical listed in ECCN 1C350 may also have different CAS numbers.

TEST, INSPECTION AND PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT\nTECHNICAL NOTES FOR 2B001 TO 2B009, 2B201, AND 2B991 TO 2B999:\n1. Secondary parallel contouring axes, (e.g., the w-axis on horizontal boring mills or a secondary rotary axis the center line of which is parallel to the primary rotary axis) are not counted in the total number of contouring axes. Rotary axes need not rotate over 360°. A rotary axis can be driven by a linear device (e.g., a screw or a rack- and-pinion). 2. The number of axes which can be coordinated simultaneously for contouring control is the number of axes along or around which, during processing of the workpiece, simultaneous and interrelated motions are performed between the workpiece and a tool. This does not include any additional axes along or around which other relative motions within the machine are performed, such as: 2.a. Wheel-dressing systems in grinding machines; 2.b. Parallel rotary axes designed for mounting of separate workpieces; 2.c. Co-linear rotary axes designed for manipulating the same workpiece by holding it in a chuck from different ends.\nExport Administration Regulations Bureau of Industry and Security  February 24, 2023 3. Axis nomenclature shall be in accordance with International Standard ISO 841:2001, Industrial automation systems and integration - Numerical control of machines - Coordinate system and motion nomenclature. 4. A tilting spindle is counted as a rotary axis. 5. Stated unidirectional positioning repeatability may be used for each specific machine model as an alternative to individual machine tests, and is determined as follows: 5.a. Select five machines of a model to be evaluated; 5.b. Measure the linear axis repeatability (R↑,R↓) according to ISO 230-2:2014 and evaluate \"unidirectional positioning repeatability\" for each axis of each of the five machines; 5.c. Determine the arithmetic mean value of the unidirectional positioning repeatability- values for each axis of all five machines together. These arithmetic mean values unidirectional positioning repeatability ( ) become the stated value of each axis for the model...)( x, y, …); 5.d. Since the Category 2 list refers to each linear axis there will be as many stated unidirectional positioning repeatability values as there are linear axes; 5.e. If any axis of a machine model not controlled by 2B001.a. to 2B001.c. has a stated unidirectional positioning repeatability equal to or less than the specified unidirectional positioning repeatability of each machine tool model plus 0.7 µm, the builder should be required to reaffirm the accuracy level once every eighteen months. 6. For the purpose of 2B, measurement uncertainty for the unidirectional positioning repeatability of machine tools, as defined in the International Standard ISO 230-2:2014, shall not be considered. 7. For the purpose of 2B, the measurement of axes shall be made according to test procedures in 5.3.2. of ISO 230-2:2014. Tests for axes longer than 2 meters shall be made over 2 m segments. Axes longer than 4 m require multiple tests (e.g., two tests for axes longer than 4 m and up to 8 m, three tests for axes longer than 8 m and up to 12 m), each over 2 m segments and distributed in equal intervals over the axis length. Test segments are equally spaced along the full axis length, with any excess length equally divided at the beginning, in between, and at the end of the test segments. The smallest \"unidirectional positioning repeatability\"-value of all test segments is to be reported."

Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) is an overlay coating or surface modification coating process wherein a metal, alloy, composite, dielectric or ceramic is deposited upon a heated substrate. Gaseous reactants are decomposed or combined in the vicinity of a substrate resulting in the deposition of the desired elemental, alloy or compound material on the substrate. Energy for this decomposition or chemical reaction process may be provided by the heat of the substrate, a glow discharge plasma, or laser irradiation.\nNote 1: CVD includes the following processes: directed gas flow out-of-pack deposition, pulsating CVD, controlled nucleation thermal decomposition (CNTD), plasma enhanced or plasma assisted CVD processes.\nNote 2: Pack denotes a substrate immersed in a powder mixture.\nNote 3: The gaseous reactants used in the out-of-pack process are produced using the same basic reactions and parameters as the pack cementation process, except that the substrate to be coated is not in contact with the powder mixture.\nb. Thermal Evaporation-Physical Vapor Deposition (TE-PVD) is an overlay coating process conducted in a vacuum with a pressure less than 0.1 Pa wherein a source of thermal energy is used to vaporize the coating material. This process results in the condensation, or deposition, of the evaporated species onto appropriately positioned substrates. The addition of gases to the vacuum chamber during the coating process to synthesize compound coatings is an ordinary modification of the process. The use of ion or electron beams, or plasma, to activate or assist the coating's deposition is also a common modification in this technique. The use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thickness of coatings can be a feature of these processes. Specific TE-PVD processes are as follows:\n1. Electron Beam PVD uses an electron beam to heat and evaporate the material which forms the coating;\n2. Ion Assisted Resistive Heating PVD employs electrically resistive heating sources in combination with impinging ion beam(s) to produce a controlled and uniform flux of evaporated coating species;\n3. Laser Vaporization uses either pulsed or continuous wave laser beams to vaporize the material which forms the coating;\n4. Cathodic Arc Deposition employs a consumable cathode of the material which forms the coating and has an arc discharge established\nExport Administration Regulations Bureau of Industry and Security  February 24, 2023 on the surface by a momentary contact of a ground trigger. Controlled motion of arcing erodes the cathode surface creating a highly ionized plasma. The anode can be either a cone attached to the periphery of the cathode, through an insulator, or the chamber. Substrate biasing is used for non line-of-sight deposition;\nNote: This definition does not include random cathodic arc deposition with non-biased substrates.\n5. Ion Plating is a special modification of a general TE-PVD process in which a plasma or an ion source is used to ionize the species to be deposited, and a negative bias is applied to the substrate in order to facilitate the extraction of the species from the plasma. The introduction of reactive species, evaporation of solids within the process chamber, and the use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thicknesses of coatings are ordinary modifications of the process.\nc. Pack Cementation is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a substrate is immersed in a powder mixture (a pack), that consists of:\n1. The metallic powders that are to be deposited (usually aluminum, chromium, silicon or combinations thereof);\n2. An activator (normally a halide salt); and\n3. An inert powder, most frequently alumina.\nNote: The substrate and powder mixture is contained within a retort which is heated to between 1,030 K (757 C) to 1,375 K (1,102 C) for sufficient time to deposit the coating.\nd. Plasma Spraying is an overlay coating process wherein a gun (spray torch) which produces and controls a plasma accepts powder or wire coating materials, melts them and propels them towards a substrate, whereon an integrally bonded coating is formed. Plasma spraying constitutes either low pressure plasma spraying or high velocity plasma spraying.\nNote 1: Low pressure means less than ambient atmospheric pressure.\nNote 2: High velocity refers to nozzle-exit gas velocity exceeding 750 m/s calculated at 293 K (20  C) at 0.1 MPa.\ne. Slurry Deposition is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a metallic or ceramic powder with an organic binder is suspended in a liquid and is applied to a substrate by either spraying, dipping or painting, subsequent air or oven drying, and heat treatment to obtain the desired coating.\nf. Sputter Deposition is an overlay coating process based on a momentum transfer phenomenon, wherein positive ions are accelerated by an electric field towards the surface of a target (coating material). The kinetic energy of the impacting ions is sufficient to cause target surface atoms to be released and deposited on an appropriately positioned substrate.\nNote 1: The Table refers only to triode, magnetron or reactive sputter deposition which is used to increase adhesion of the coating and rate of deposition and to radio frequency (RF) augmented sputter deposition used to permit vaporization of non-metallic coating materials.\nNote 2: Low-energy ion beams (less than 5 keV) can be used to activate the deposition.\ng. Ion Implantation is a surface modification coating process in which the element to be\nExport Administration Regulations Bureau of Industry and Security  February 24, 2023 alloyed is ionized, accelerated through a potential gradient and implanted into the surface region of the substrate. This includes processes in which ion implantation is performed simultaneously with electron beam physical vapor deposition or sputter deposition.\nAccompanying Technical Information to Table on Deposition Techniques:\n1.

One or more analog, multi-value, or multi- level primitive computational units having a processing performance measured in TOPS multiplied by 8, aggregated over all computational units, of 4800 or more; or\n a.4. Any combination of digital processor units and primitive computational units whose calculations according to 3A090.a.1, 3A090.a.2, and 3A090.a.3 sum to 4800 or more.\n Note: Integrated circuits specified by 3A090.a include graphical processing units (GPUs), tensor processing units (TPUs), neural processors, in-memory processors, vision processors, text processors, co- processors/accelerators, adaptive processors, field-programmable logic devices (FPLDs), and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Examples of integrated circuits are in the Note to 3A001.a.\n Technical Notes:\n1. A primitive computational unit is defined as containing zero or more modifiable weights, receiving one or more inputs, and producing one or more outputs. A computational unit is said to perform 2N-1 operations whenever an output is updated based on N inputs, where each modifiable weight contained in the processing element counts as an input. Each input, weight, and output might be an analog signal level or a scalar digital value represented using one or more bits. Such units include:\n- Artificial neurons - Multiply accumulate (MAC) units - Floating-point units (FPUs) - Analog multiplier units - Processing units using memristors, spintronics, or magnonics - Processing units using photonics or non- linear optics - Processing units using analog or multi- level nonvolatile weights - Processing units using multi-level memory or analog memory - Multi-value units - Spiking units\n2. Operations relevant to the calculation of TOPS for 3A090.a include both scalar operations and the scalar constituents of composite operations such as vector operations, matrix operations, and tensor operations. Scalar operations include integer operations, floating-point operations (often measured by FLOPS), fixed-point operations, bit-manipulation operations, and/or bitwise operations.\n3. TOPS is Tera Operations Per Second or 10 12\nOperations per Second.\n4. The rate of TOPS is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible when all processing elements are operating simultaneously. The rate of TOPS and aggregate bidirectional transfer rate is assumed to be the highest value the manufacturer claims in a manual or brochure for the integrated circuit. For example, the threshold of 4800 bits x TOPS can be met with 600 tera integer operations at 8 bits or 300 tera FLOPS at 16 bits. The bit length of an operation is equal to the highest bit length of any input or output of that operation. Additionally, if an item specified by this entry is designed for operations that achieve different bits x TOPS value, the highest bits x TOPS value should be used for the purposes of 3A090.a.\n5. For integrated circuits specified by 3A090.a that provide processing of both sparse and dense matrices, the TOPS values are the values for processing of dense matrices (e.g., without sparsity).\nb.

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPO i , performed per cycle for each processor in the digital computer.\n Note: In determining FPO, include only 64- bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero.\n 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor\n R i = FPO i /t i .\n 3. Calculate APP as\n APP = W 1 x R 1 + W 2 x R 2 + … + W n x R n .\n 4. For vector processors, W i = 0.9. For non-vector processors, W i = 0.3.\n Note 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\n Note 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\n Note 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the APP of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\n Note 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating APP.\n Note 5: APP values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by Local Area Networks, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by Commerce Control List  Supplement No. 1 to Part 774       Category 4—page 15\nsoftware.\n Note 6: APP values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors specially designed to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory\nTechnical Notes\n 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die.\n 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using electronic assemblies specified in 4A003.c.\n Note 7: A vector processor is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.
